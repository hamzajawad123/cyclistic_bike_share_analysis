# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study  

## Overview  
This project is part of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone**.  

The objective is to analyze **Cyclistic’s bike-share data** to understand how casual riders and annual members use the service differently. Insights are then used to recommend strategies that convert casual riders into paying members, ultimately boosting revenue.  

---

## Business Task  
Design **data-driven marketing strategies** to maximize annual memberships by:  
- Identifying behavioral differences between casual riders and members.  
- Highlighting patterns in ride duration, frequency, and seasonality.  
- Supporting recommendations with visual evidence.

## Datasets  
The data comes from **Divvy (Cyclistic) trip data**, made publicly available by Motivate International Inc.  

- [Divvy Trips Q1 2019 – Raw](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hamzajawad123/divvy-trips-2019-q1-dataset)
- [Divvy Trips Q1 2020 – Raw](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hamzajawad123/divvy-trips-2020-q1-datasets)
- [Cleaned Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hamzajawad123/cleaned-merged-final-2019-2020-dataset)  

> Note: Due to GitHub file size restrictions, the datasets are hosted on **Kaggle**.

## Process  
The analysis followed the **six-step data analysis framework**:  

1. **Ask** – Define the problem: “How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?”  
2. **Prepare** – Collect and combine 2019 Q1 and 2020 Q1 datasets.  
3. **Process** – Clean data (remove nulls, duplicates, inconsistencies).  
4. **Analyze** – Compare ride patterns, durations, weekly trends, and seasonal differences.  
5. **Share** – Build reports, dashboards, and visualizations to communicate findings.  
6. **Act** – Recommend strategies to convert casual riders into members.  

---

## Key Insights  
- **Casual riders**: Longer average ride durations but less frequent use.  
- **Members**: Shorter rides but more consistent daily and weekly usage.  
- **Seasonality**: Casual rider usage peaks during weekends and warmer months.  
- **Potential Growth**: Targeting casual riders with flexible membership packages can increase conversions.
